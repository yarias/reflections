When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   
   Having a remote repository is useful if you want to share the content with different 
   people, having others working on it adding their changes, or get access to your work
   fro different PCs.
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Beacause we can choose when and what to pull from the remote repo. If it is done automatically 
   we can pull unnecessary commits to our local repo. 
   
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

   Clone: it allows to clone a GitHub repository in your local machine or even clone a local repository 
   into anonther local directory. it is used if you want to work on your local machine 
   
   Branches: It allows to get a branch from the master branch to work on the code, add new features, test the new
   implementations without affecting the working code (master)
   
   Fork: it allows to clone a GitHub repository directly in you GitHub account using the GitHub repositories 
   skipping the step to clone the repo in your local machine and then push it into your GitHub account. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

   If I do not have Internet access and I have my local repo updated to the last known state of the remote 
   one, I can look at any point I like, work on my work and then merge offline if needed.
   
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

   Without Git or GitHub, I's suggest to use a share folder like Dropbox or Google Drive, the difficult part would
   be everybody working on the same part since it can raise a bug.
