When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   
   Having a remote repository is useful if you want to share the content with different 
   people, having others working on it adding their changes, or get access to your work
   fro different PCs.
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Beacause we can choose when and what to pull from the remote repo. If it is done automatically 
   we can pull unnecessary commits to our local repo.
